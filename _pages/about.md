I am a Ph.D. student in **Data Science and Analytics** at **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)**, advised by **Prof. Xinlei He**. My research focuses on **Trustworthy AI**, especially **AI security and safety**.

Recently, I have been working on adversarial/backdoor attacks and safety evaluation for modern foundation models (e.g., prompt-driven video segmentation and multimodal LLMs).

### Research interests
- Trustworthy AI (security & safety)
- Adversarial attacks & robustness
- Backdoor attacks on foundation models
- Multimodal LLM jailbreaking & safety alignment
- Measurement of AI-generated content on social media
